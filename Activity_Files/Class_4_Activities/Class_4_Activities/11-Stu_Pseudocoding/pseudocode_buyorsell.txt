Calculate percent decrease in stock price: 

    --- Increase = Current Price - Original Price 
    --- Percent Increase = Increase / Original Price * 100 

    Variables: 
        --- increase_in_price 
        --- original_price
        --- current_price
        --- percent_increase
        --- port_balance

Identify a viable percent increase/decrease that will indicate buy or 
sell action (assume a 20 % increase or decrease in stock price should 
warrant a buy or sell): (Determine whether a stock should be purchased or sold)

    Variables: 
        --- threshold_to_sell --> if the stock's price increase percentage is HIGHER than 20 %, trigger a SELL 
        --- threshold_to_buy --> if the stock's price increase percentage is LOWER than 20%, trigger a BUY
