A.) What does FinTech mean to you? Why is it important? 

--- I think FinTech is essentially "digital finance" or "smart money". 

--- Fintech refers to modern technologies and software that provide fast 
--- and innovative services for consumers such as mobile payments or automated
--- banking services. 

--- The Fintech industry is growing rapidly and is expected to reach an estimated 
--- market value of $310 billion by the end of 2022. 

B.) What about FinTech interests you? 

--- The Fintech Industry is huge and growing exponentially. As an emerging market continues 
--- to grow, I believe many opportunities will appear such as new jobs and new startups to invest in. 

C.) Where do you expect Fintech to take you? What are you looking to do?  

--- Automated banking is exciting and a growing field. I want to learn more about AI,
--- and its effect on finances. I've had the privilege of earning a decent crypto-currency 
--- portfolio and would love to use what I learn in this bootcamp to improve my investments. 

D.) What about Fintech may be confusing? What makes sense? 

--- At first I thought Fintech was just one piece of software that helped ease banking services, however
--- I learned that Fintech is an broad emerging market. The Fintech market includes things such as automated banking 
--- services, crypto-currency services, lending & borrowing services, insurance, and much more. 

--- What makes sense to me is Fintech is a form of digital banking or financial technology.
